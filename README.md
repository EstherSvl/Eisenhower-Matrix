# ‚ú®Eisenhower Matrix‚ú®

Welcome to the README for my first public coding endeavour: Eisenhower Matrix.

What are you looking at?

It does what it says on the tin, folks! As an executive leader, my to-do lists be long. Very long. And so keeping my tasks in a list format, with flags, do tomorrow non-sense etc. doesn't work for me. Have you ever seen a list of over 100 tasks? I need order in my chaos, please. The Eisenhower Matrix is a solid productivity tool that I like to use to visualise where are my tasks sit in terms of urgency and importance. 

# By using the Eisenhower Matrix, you can:
* Prioritize tasks effectively
* Manage your time more efficiently
* Reduce stress and increase productivity
* Focus on what‚Äôs truly important and eliminate non-essential tasks

Why are we even racing? üèéÔ∏è (a.k.a Why can I be bothered to spend time building this?)

I have not found my solution in the COTS market, so it's time to solve my own problems myself even though I am definitely not the smartest person in the Dev shed. I suspect I won't get to be a millionaire or a global impact maker with this app, but if I'm happy with it, that's good enough. And if I'm happy, I'm thinking there's a good chance others would be happy with it too, since I pride myself to be a rather discerning productivity app customer. And if GitHub allows me to share this work with other people and make them happy, then perhaps there's a shot in hell I've actually improved people's lives. The only remaining challenge is to see whether my coding and design skills live up to my ambition (I doubt it IMHO), but let's goooooo! üöÄ

Quick Start
---

To apply the Eisenhower Matrix, follow these steps:
* Write down all your tasks, big and small.
* Evaluate each task based on its urgency and importance.
* Plot each task on the matrix according to its urgency and importance.
* Focus on the tasks in the ‚ÄúUrgent and Important‚Äù quadrant first.
* Schedule tasks in the ‚ÄúImportant but Not Urgent‚Äù quadrant.
* Delegate tasks in the ‚ÄúUrgent but Not Important‚Äù quadrant.
* Eliminate tasks in the ‚ÄúNeither Urgent nor Important‚Äù quadrant.
  
Usage

The Eisenhower Matrix is a simple yet powerful tool for prioritizing tasks based on their urgency and importance. Developed by Dwight D. Eisenhower, the 34th President of the United States, this matrix helps individuals and organizations focus on the most critical tasks and manage their time effectively.

The Eisenhower Matrix consists of four quadrants, each representing a combination of urgency and importance:

## 1. Urgent and Important (Do First):
Tasks that are both urgent and important require immediate attention. These tasks typically have deadlines and significant consequences for not completing them on time. Examples include:
* Crisis management
* Deadlines for critical projects
* Emergency repairs

## Important but Not Urgent (Schedule): 
Tasks that are important but not urgent should be scheduled and planned for. These tasks contribute to long-term goals and values, but do not have immediate deadlines. Examples include:
* Planning and strategy development
* Skill development and learning
* Relationship building and networking

## Urgent but Not Important (Delegate): 
Tasks that are urgent but not important can be delegated to others. These tasks often create distractions and consume time, but do not have significant consequences for not completing them. Examples include:
* Responding to non-essential emails
* Attending non-essential meetings
* Busywork or administrative tasks

## Neither Urgent nor Important (Eliminate): 
Tasks that are neither urgent nor important should be eliminated or minimized. These tasks often waste time and energy, and do not contribute to long-term goals or values. Examples include:
* Watching excessive TV or social media
* Engaging in gossip or non-productive conversations
* Procrastination or unnecessary busywork

For now I need to first build the app, but the best way you can help me as this is my first app building experience is to suggest better ways of building things or visualizing things, making a better UX experience and fixing my code to make it more sturdy.
